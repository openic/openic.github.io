		<div class="competitionDescription">
				<p>Casabella challenges you to design a compact bathroom mop.</p>
				<p>Create a compact bathroom mop intended to clean the floor area around the toilet, not inside, with a disposable cloth. The mop should be compact, perhaps foldable, to be easily stored in small places. Also the mop should be easy to maneuver and capable of going into small places around the toilet. The cleaning pad should be able to work with a disposable cloth, easily removable, preferentially without the consumer having to touch it with their hands.

					<h3>About Casabella</h3>
						<img alt="Thumb" class="logo" src="https://d2t1xqejof9utc.cloudfront.net/competitions/logos/294/thumb.jpg?1400762166" />
					<p>The origins of <a href="http://casabella.com/">Casabella</a> date back to 1985 when Bruce Kaminstein was managing his family’s hardware store in New York City. The neighborhood was gentrifying and Bruce was seeking new exciting products to sell to the changing clientele. While vacationing in Italy he visited a housewares trade show and fell in love…with a mop. It was a basic item, but well designed and made with high quality materials. He decided to buy a 20 foot container. Somehow it showed up at the store 6 months later and the product was a huge success.</p>

<p>That recipe: commodity product, beautiful design and high quality workmanship laid the foundation for Casabella’s consistent growth and market leadership</p>

<p>Today Casabella operates out of a 100,000 square foot building in Rockland County, NY about 40 minutes north of Manhattan. We design products in-house and manufacture worldwide. Casabella cleaning tools, kitchen and bath accessories and organizing products have received numerous design awards and industry recognition. They can be purchased at retail stores throughout the U.S. as well as internationally and on the web.</p>

			<p>phenomenal.....I love how royalties, or at least chance there of, are being incorporated more and more into these challenges......it's only fair in certain circumstances, nice incentive for designers also. It's a tough industry to make a living in. Royalties help. Good luck to all!</p>

			<p>Hi to all. Thanks for participating in our challenge. Good Luck! Yes, the mop head is supposed to be small... not bigger than a 7 inches diameter. It doesn't have to be circular, just not bigger than this. Also we don't need a bucket. It doesn't have to wring water. It can work with a disposable wet cloth. </p>

			<p>Also, slightly confused about the mob head requirement! If it should be able to be inserted on a 7 inches circle, does that mean the mob head should be detachable from the handle??</p>

			<p>Hi, the requirement of being able to insert on a 7 inches circle is just a reference to the size of the head. We just want a small head, that its biggest dimension should not exceed 7 inches. No need to specify the material of the cloth. I doesn't even have to be a disposable cloth. It can work with one, but not an obligation.</p>
